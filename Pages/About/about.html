        The Year 2023 has brought Capacity bay my way. I am victor Omolowo , a lover of Tech, a sound engineer , a graphic designer ,
        a wordpress designer, let me drop the Mic here. Tech is the future and i want to sieze eevery oppurtunity available to me To 
        learn and acquire as much knowledge as i can so as to position myself for the future. Capacity Bay has really come through
        for me,  i told myself this year that i must learn how to code either front end or backend, But i am glad having this oppurtunity to learn both for free.
